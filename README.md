# qemit â€” VS Code â†’ AMQP (1.0) one-click publisher

Publish the contents of your current editor to an AMQP 1.0 broker straight from a tidy VS Code sidebar. Save multiple broker credentials securely, switch between them in a dropdown, and fire messages without leaving your editor.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- **Sidebar UI** (Webview) to publish the *active editorâ€™s* text to an AMQP topic/address  
- **Multiple brokers + credentials** saved and selectable from a dropdown  
- **Secure secrets storage** via `context.secrets` (passwords arenâ€™t stored in plaintext)  
- **AMQP 1.0** publishing using [`rhea`](https://github.com/amqp/rhea)  
- **TLS support** (`amqps://`); automatic default ports (`5671` for TLS, `5672` otherwise)  
- **Nice-to-have UX**: add/delete credentials, minimal dark UI, safe CSP with nonce

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1. **Launch the extension**
   - Youâ€™ll see the **QEmit** sidebar view (id: `qemitForm`).  
     If you donâ€™t, open *View â†’ Appearance â†’ Primary Side Bar*, then search for the view by name or id.

2. **Add credentials**
   - In the sidebar, click **Add Credentials**.
   - Fill in:
     - **Username**
     - **Password**
     - **Broker Host** (e.g. `amqps://broker.example.com:5671` or `amqp://localhost:5672`)
   - Save. The broker appears in the dropdown.

3. **Publish**
   - Open the file you want to publish (it must be the *active editor*).
   - Select a saved broker (or type a host if you have none saved).
   - Enter **Topic** / **Address** (e.g. `queue://test`).
   - Click **Publish**.  
     Youâ€™ll get a toast on success, or a readable error if something fails.

## ðŸ”§ Configuration & behavior

### Broker URL
- **TLS:** `amqps://host[:port]` â†’ uses `transport: "tls"`, sends `username/password`.
- **Non-TLS:** `amqp://host[:port]` â†’ connects without TLS.  
  > Note: in the current implementation, non-TLS connections **do not** send `username/password` (the fields are commented out in code). Ensure your broker allows that or use TLS.

### Topic / Address
- Passed directly to `rhea` as the sender address:  
  `sender = connection.open_sender(<topicOrAddress>)`  
- Examples: `queue://test`, `orders`, `/amq/queue/foo` â€” use the addressing scheme your broker expects.

### What gets sent?
- **Exactly the full text** of the active editor as the AMQP message **body**.
- No custom headers/properties are attached.
